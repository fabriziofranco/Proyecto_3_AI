Images
======
The 'images' folder contains a total of 832 images for ten butterfly categories, in PNG format.
Naming convention: Each image is prefixed with the category ID of the butterfly (001, 002, ..., 010) followed by the sequence number of the image within the category. Please note that the sequence numbers may not necessarily be consecutive.

The scientific (Latin) names of the butterfly categories are:
001: Danaus plexippus	
002: Heliconius charitonius	
003: Heliconius erato	
004: Junonia coenia	
005: Lycaena phlaeas
006: Nymphalis antiopa	
007: Papilio cresphontes	
008: Pieris rapae	
009: Vanessa atalanta	
010: Vanessa cardui


Segmentation masks
==================
The 'segmentations' folder contains segmentation masks of each image in PNG format. Pixels with values 1 and 3 represent foreground pixels, and others background pixels.
Please refer to our BMVC2009 paper for more details on how the segmentation masks were generated.
